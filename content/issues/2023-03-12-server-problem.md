# Hello all!

We are making this to notify about the changes that are ongoing to the server, known simply as, "dark zenth v1", on our platform server.

The server, that was now made for only the Raspberry Pi 4, with nginx, is currently dissrupting our or the founder home network,
where the server is currently located right now!

As of now, the server, which in due to be fixed, will be offline for the time being, unless we use GitHub Pages for just the main page.

We will keep you updated for the time being when it's back on!

This does include the following services:

1. Subsonic server

2. Apache server (going to be named nginx soon!)

3. Discord bots

4. TTHosting

5. TTMail

We know that some of your services are affected somewhat, but we will soon recover any data lost as we can!

**Thank you for sticking around with TTNRT!**
