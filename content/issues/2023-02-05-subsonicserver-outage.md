## The server has changed clients today!

~~You should notice about our music server, and how it's giving a loading screen~~

~~This is not a error, it just means our cloudflare is using the thing to redirect you to `https` from `http`!~~

~~However, that is going to be fixed on the server to host it with port **443** in time this week.~~

~~For now, please note that the site is not able to reposond to you at this time, due to the port being `80` at the time being!~~

~~It is **not down currently**, and will be resolved by our team lead or technician's to solve as soon as posabile!~~

~~We are also adding more features to this server soon, once full information is gattered!~~

**Thank you reading this message!**

**UPDATE 11:32 PM EST**

The Server is back up and running! The issue is now resolved.
